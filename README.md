# F1
F1 car model (2018 car)

Calibration only.

areafind: find frontal area of the car via black + white image. Initial wing calaculations. 
f1forces: calculates the acceleration from the forces.
f1eqs: calculates velocity from acceleration.
f1carpar: finds the required parameters (constants) for motion equations from a limited number of known cosntants and data. Plots various graphs from the equations and found constants.
f1car: numerically intergrates the required equations and plots the results (drive motion only).
